Movico is not just another MVC framework for PHP. It is inspired by [Java Server Faces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Faces) principles and other enterprise Java frameworks such as [Liferay Portal](http://www.liferay.com) and the [Spring](http://www.springsource.org) framework. It supports:
  * Automatic classloading
  * Writing request-scoped, session-scoped and application-scoped **backing beans**
  * Writing **XML views** with rich JSF-like components (inputRichText, dataTable, ...)
  * **Template** definitions based on JSF facelets, to reuse chunks of views that are to be included in multiple views
  * Auto-generation of service and domain layer from an entity definition file using the **Service Builder**
  * Full support for AJAX, including AJAX file uploads, bookmarkable URLs and working Back button.
