**Peter Mesotten** is a J2EE developer who's playing with PHP for some time now. While he likes J2EE for its robustness, he also admires PHP for its ease of development and deployment, and its popularity worldwide.

The goal of PHP-Movico is to provide a JSF-like framework for PHP for the front-end, together with a Hibernate-like framework for the back-end.
