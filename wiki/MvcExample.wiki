#summary Simple example demonstrating MVC in Movico
#labels example,movico

In this simple example we'll create a simple view containing an input field and a button. When a user enters his/her name into the field and presses the button, the page will display "Hello" followed by the name that was just entered.

= View =

A view in Movico is like a JSP page in JSF. In Movico, it is a strict XML file that is validated by a DTD. This is the view for our sample application (it is called {{{hello.xml}}} in the source code):

{{{
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE note SYSTEM "http://php-movico.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/php-movico/dtd/view.dtd">
<view>
    <outputText value="#{HelloBean.message}"/>
    <form>
        <inputText value="#{HelloBean.name}"/>
        <commandButton action="#{HelloBean.sayHello}" value="Say Hello!"/>
    </form>
</view>
}}}

Every view should have the {{{<view>}}} element as a root element. Inside it we created an {{{outputText}}} element with a {{{value}}} attribute that binds to the {{{message}}} property on the {{{HelloBean}}} managed bean. An {{{outputText}}} will render an HTML {{{<span>}}} element.

Next we defined a {{{<form>}}} element containing an {{{inputText}}} and a {{{commandButton}}}. The {{{inputText}}} binds to the bean's {{{name}}} field while the {{{commandButton}}}, that will render a submit button, will execute the {{{sayHello}}} action method on the bean.

This should all look very familiar to you if you've ever used JSF. 

= Bean =

Like in JSF, Movico beans bind values of view elements (like the {{{inputText}}} and {{{commandButton}}} we just defined in our {{{hello.xml}}} view) to class properties. 

We know from the view that our managed bean should hold a field {{{name}}} (with its getter and setter) that will bind to the input field, and a {{{message}}} field that is to be displayed in the {{{outputText}}} of the view.

The action method {{{sayHello}}} appends the entered name to the {{{"Hello"}}} string and assigns this value to {{{message}}}.

{{{
<?php
class HelloBean extends RequestBean {
	
    private $name;
    private $message;

    public function sayHello() {
        $this->message = "Hello, ".$this->name."!";
        return "hello";
    }
	
    public function getName() {
        return $this->name;
    }
	
    public function setName($name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }
	
    public function getMessage() {
        return $this->message;
    }
	
}
?>
}}}

At last the method returns "{{{view}}}", which is the view (without the {{{.xml}}}) to navigate to after this method has been executed. In this case it is the same view we came from ({{{hello.xml}}}). Instead we could have returned {{{null}}}, because in that case the previous view is considered as the new view as well.

Note that our bean extends {{{RequestBean}}}. This means that the bean will be in request scope so it will be reinstantiated on subsequent requests. Read more about bean scopes [WritingBackingBeans#Bean_scopes here].

= That's it! =

This is all you need for a working Movico application! Notice that:
 * By only programming for 2 minutes and adding 2 files you already have (admit it) an awesome application
 * You don't have to learn new components because they all resemble JSF components.
 * You're programming your beans in a nice OO way by only exposing properties you want to expose (through public accessors) and encapsulating non-public stuff.
 * But wait... You didn't do anything database related yet. No worries, check out the [ServiceBuilder] page for that.
