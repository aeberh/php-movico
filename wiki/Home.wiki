#summary About Movico

= What is Movico? =

Movico is not just another MVC framework for PHP! It is inspired by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Faces Java Server Faces] principles and other enterprise frameworks such as [http://www.liferay.com Liferay Portal]. It supports:
 * Writing request-scoped and session-scoped *backing beans*
 * Writing *XML views* with rich JSF-like components (inputRichText, dataTable, ...)
 * Auto-generation of service layer from an entity definition file using the *Service Builder*

Under construction:
 * View templating
 * AJAX support
 * ORM support

== Convention over configuration ==

A lot of frameworks still need heavy configuration. In Movico the use of configuration files is very limited. Rather, developers need to know just a few (obvious) conventions and he is good to go.

== OO all the way ==

If you don't like to code object oriented this framework is _not_ for you. Unlike many other PHP frameworks, Movico is *100% object oriented* and the developer is _obliged_ to write OO code.

== Support ==

Movico is written in *PHP 5.2*. It currently only supports *MySQL* as a database.
