#summary About Movico

= What is Movico? =

Movico is not just another MVC framework for PHP! It is inspired by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Faces Java Server Faces] principles and other enterprise frameworks such as [http://www.liferay.com Liferay Portal]. It supports
 * Writing request-scoped and session-scoped *backing beans*
 * Writing *XML views* with rich JSF-like components (inputText, dataTable, ...)
 * Auto-generation of service layer from an entity definition file using the *Service Builder*

== OO all the way ==

If you don't like to code object oriented this framework is _not_ for you. Movico is *100% object oriented* and the developer is obliged to write OO code.

== Support ==

Movico is written in *PHP 5*. It currently only supports *MySQL*. It can be used on any PHP hosting provider out there.
