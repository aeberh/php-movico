= Usage =

== Configuring the API key ==
It is very easy to include maps from Google Maps inside your application. The first thing you need to do for this is to request a new API key. Check [http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html this] link to sign up for an API key and to read more information.

Once you've received the API key, configure the {{{gmaps_api_key}}} inside the {{{main.conf}}} configuration file:
{{{
gmaps_api_key=ABQIAAAAx_lFmPrs_Gkl6KMgU-Z9aRT2yXp_ZAY8_ufC3CFXhHIE1NvwkxTSiMpaub_ph7dOeTqVyazTRWS5SA
}}}

== Using the component ==
At this point, Movico provides one component for displaying a Google Map with a certain width and height, centered at a certain address. This component uses the Google Maps Javascript API V2 to display the map. Basically, this is how to use the component in your views:
{{{
<googleMap address="Biesweg, Gellik, Belgium" width="400" height="300" zoomLevel="15"/>
}}}
This will display a map like so:
